# spotify_api_scraper
This program allows to know the segmented and complete discography of an entered artist. It was applied using the Spotify API, please note that to use it you must have a Spotify account with a Client ID and a Secret ID.

The program will first ask you to enter the name of an artist, organizes the search result by the most popular artist and then returns the discography, if you want to know the songs you will need to enter the ID of the album.

This program was made thanks to Professor Sokolowicz from Platzi!
